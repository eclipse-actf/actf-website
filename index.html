				<h1>Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF)</h1>
				<p>The Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF) is a subproject of the Eclipse Technology Project.</p>
				<p>ACTF is a framework that serves as an extensible infrastructure upon which developers can build a variety of
					utilities that help to evaluate and enhance the accessibility of applications and content for people with
					disabilities. A collection of example utilities will also be provided which were created on top of the framework
					such as compliance validation tools, assistive technology simulation applications, usability visualization tools,
					unit-testing utilities, and alternative accessible interfaces for applications. The ACTF componentry and the
					utilities will be integrated into a single tooling environment on top of the Eclipse framework. The framework
					components will function cooperatively with each other and with other Eclipse projects to provide a comprehensive
					development environment for creating accessible applications and content.</p>
